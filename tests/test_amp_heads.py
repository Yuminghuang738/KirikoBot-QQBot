"""The amp-head library (箱头库).

The daily push that used to read from this table is gone (the official
platform has no proactive push), but the curated dataset and the table stay:
the dashboard still shows the library and it backs on-demand lookups. These
tests care about two things: that the dataset stays sane and seeds
idempotently, and that "head of the day" picks deterministically.
