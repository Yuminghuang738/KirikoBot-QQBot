"""Conversation history for the model: how a turn is stored and replayed.

This lives outside `main.py` on purpose. Both halves of the bug fixed here are
invisible at runtime — they only show up as the model answering the wrong
message — so they need to be directly testable, and `main` starts the
scheduler on import.

The invariant this module exists to protect: **the context must never contain
two user turns in a row.** A turn where the bot replied with nothing at all
used to be stored as a lone user row, which left an unanswered question in the
context forever. The next request then carried two questions, and the model
dutifully answered the stale one alongside the new one — the user sees the bot
"replying to my last message again". Measured on a live database, roughly one
turn in ten used to be stored this way.
