"""HTTP Basic auth for the KirikoBot dashboard.

The panel is far more powerful than it looks: it can delete a group and all of
its data, read every chat log, and send messages as the bot. It therefore must
not be reachable without a credential.

Design notes
------------
* HTTP Basic is used deliberately: it needs no session store, and the browser
  replays the credentials for same-origin subresources (stickers) and
  ``EventSource`` streams, which a naive cookie login would have to special-case.
* The OneBot webhook is exempt: it carries its own HMAC signature (see
  ``main._webhook_signature_ok``) and cannot present dashboard credentials.
* Basic auth over plain HTTP is only as private as the network. Put the panel
  behind HTTPS (or a reverse proxy that terminates TLS) before exposing it.
